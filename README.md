Abanoub: here are the instructions for the final test repository.

## Repository Files

  This web_app.py is used for python code for the web app.

- `template.html`  
  This template.html is used the template for the web app.

## Reflection on Version Control and Cloning

For this final test I used Git and GitHub to manage my work. I created the repository **Abanoub_final_test_p2**, added a milestone, and created issues that described the work for the web application files. Each change was committed with clear messages so the history of the project is easy to follow.

I also cloned a public repository to my local machine using `git clone`. This helped me understand how to work with a remote project, explore the code offline, and practice basic commands such as `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`. Working with branches and commits showed me how changes can be tracked, rolled back, and reviewed.

Using Git and GitHub in this way made the workflow more organized and more reliable. I can see exactly what I changed and when, and I can connect the issues, milestone, and commits together as one process.
